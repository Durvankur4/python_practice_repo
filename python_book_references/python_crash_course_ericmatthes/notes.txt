### VARIABLES :-
    variables are lables that you can assign value to

    reassiging a variable is valid


### METHODS :-
    method is and action that python can perform on a piece of data 


### INTEGERS AND FLOATS :-
    when you divide a int even with another int they result in a FLOATS

    1000 is same as 1_000


### LISTS :-
    #removing items -
        del statement : if you dont want to use that item
        pop() method : if you are going to use that item as you remove it  
        remove() method : removes the first occurance of the element 

    #sorting behaviour -
        sort() method : sorts list permanently ASCII
        sorted() func : sorts list temporarily ASCII
        reverse() method : only reverse doesnt sort

    #list[form:upto:step] - spliting list using slice

    #copying list - 
        list1 = [1,2,3,4]
        list2 = list1 both reference the same list

        list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
        list2 = list1[:] list2 is stores a new copy of the list1


### TUPLE :-
    tuples are jsut like list but use () and are immutable

    to define a tuple with one element you need to add trailing comma
    my_tupple = (3,)


### IF ELIF ELSE :-
    if-elif-else this chain is powerful, but its only appropriate to use when you just need to
    test one pass 
    as soon as python finds one test that psses all other are skipped


### Ditionaries :- 
    in python dicts are a collection of key:value pair 

    #accessing value in dict - 
        get(key,option) method : 
        if key exist and its value doesnt it returns None
        if key doesnt exist it returns option


### While loops :- 
    make use of flags in while loops 


###Functions :-
    make use of keyword arguements by using the exact name of the patamerters in the func definition

    #passing Arbitrary Number of Atguements -
    def func_name(*keyword) in this the astrick tells python to make and empty tuple called keyword 
    and pack wahtever value it revieves into the tuple.

    #Arbitrary keyword arguements - 
    **kwargs makes a dict of key:value pair to accept anynumber of keyword arguements

###Class :- 
    class is defining the genreal behaviour that a whole category of objects can have.

    __init__(self) :- the self parameter is required in the method definition and it must come before any other param
    method call will automatically passes the self arguement.

    the two variables defined at each have the prefix self, these variables which are accessible through instance are
    called attributes

    #inheritance :- 
    you can inherite class by using class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    also the super().__init__(attributes of ParentClass) will add the attributes to the ChildClass 

###Files and Excpetions :-
    when you use the with in file object returned by open() is only avaliable inside the with block 
    what contains it.

    when you open file in 'w' mode Python rewites the flie entirely

    you should never expose your tracback calls this might leave your files exposed to attackers 
    instead use try and except block 
    
    #common errors in python :
    SyntaxError: Incorrect code structure, such as missing colons or parentheses.
    NameError: Using a variable or name that hasn't been defined.
    TypeError: Performing operations on incompatible data types.
    IndexError: Accessing a sequence index that is out of range.
    KeyError: Referencing a dictionary key that doesn’t exist.
    AttributeError: Accessing an attribute or method that doesn’t exist on an object.
