    #copying list - 
        list1 = [1,2,3,4]
        list2 = list1 both reference the same list

        list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
        list2 = list1[:] list2 is stores a new copy of the list1


### TUPLE :-
    tuples are jsut like list but use () and are immutable

    to define a tuple with one element you need to add trailing comma
    my_tupple = (3,)
