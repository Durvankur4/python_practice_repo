# Quesiton:
# Given the beginning of a linked list head, return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
# There is a cycle in a linked list if at least one node in the list can be visited again by following the next pointer.
# Internlly, index determines the index of the beginning of the cycle, if it exists. The tail node of the list will set it's next pointer to the index-th node. If index = -1, then the tail node points to null and no cycle exists.
# Note: index is not given to you as a parameter.

# Solution:
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, nxt=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = nxt


def hascycle(head: ListNode):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        fast = fast.next.next
        slow = slow.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False


# time complexity = O(n)
# space complexity = O(n)
