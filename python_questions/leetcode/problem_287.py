# Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

# There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

# You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.


# Solution:
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow, fast = 0, 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            fast = nums[nums[fast]]
            if slow == fast:
                break

        slow2 = 0
        while True:
            slow = nums[slow]
            slow2 = nums[slow2]
            if slow == slow2:
                return slow


# time complexity = O(n)
# space complexity = O(n)
